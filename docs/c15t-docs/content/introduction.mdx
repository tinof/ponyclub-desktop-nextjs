## What is Consent Management?

Consent Management (c15t) is an open-source platform that transforms privacy consent from a compliance checkbox into a fully observable system. Built for modern development teams, it provides a unified solution for:

- Analytics integration
- Consent management
- Privacy controls
- Complete consent state visibility

Gone are the days of:
- Cookie banners slowing down your site
- Blind spots in consent tracking
- Complex multi-vendor implementations 
- Uncertainty about privacy policy changes
- Poor visibility into consent states


## Core Principles

### 1. Open Source First
Building in public isn't just about transparency - it's about creating better tools through community collaboration. Our open-source foundation means you can:

- Inspect and understand the code handling user consent
- Contribute improvements and fixes
- Self-host for complete control
- Trust through transparency

### 2. Developer Experience 
Privacy management should feel natural in your development workflow:

- TypeScript-first APIs with full type safety
- Modern React patterns and hooks
- Intuitive state management
- Comprehensive documentation

### 3. Performance as Standard
Every byte matters. c15t is built with performance in mind:

- Minimal bundle impact
- Efficient state management
- Optimized server/client patterns
- Smart code splitting

### 4. Privacy by Design
Privacy isn't an afterthought - it's a core part of modern web development:

- GDPR-compliant by default
- Granular consent controls
- Complete audit trail
- Privacy-first architecture
