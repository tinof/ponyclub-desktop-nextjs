The Cookie Banner component provides an elegant way to obtain and manage cookie consent from your users. It handles all the complexity of privacy regulations while providing a smooth user experience that integrates naturally with your application.

## Understanding Cookie Consent

Before diving into implementation, let's understand what makes a cookie banner effective. A good cookie banner needs to:

- Inform users about data collection clearly and concisely
- Obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies
- Provide easy ways to accept, reject, or customize preferences
- Remember user choices across sessions
- Meet legal requirements across different jurisdictions

Our Cookie Banner component handles all of these requirements automatically, while remaining fully customizable to match your application's design.

## Quick Start

Let's add a basic cookie banner to your application. First, install the package: 
```package-install
@c15t/react
```

Then add the banner to your root component:

```tsx
import {
	ConsentManagerProvider,
	CookieBanner,
} from "@c15t/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <ConsentManagerProvider>
      <YourApp />
      <CookieBanner />
    </ConsentManagerProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! The banner will automatically:

- Appear on first visit
- Remember user choices
- Handle consent management
- Stay compliant with privacy laws

## Component Architecture

The Cookie Banner uses a compound component pattern, giving you complete control over its structure when needed. Think of it like building blocks – you can use the pre-assembled version, or arrange the pieces yourself for custom layouts.

<Tabs groupId="Version" items={["Recommended", "Expanded"]}>
  <Tab value="Recommended">
  ```tsx 
import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";

const Banner = () => {
	return (
		<CookieBanner
			title="We value your privacy"
			description="We use cookies to enhance your experience"
		/>
	);
};

````
</Tab>
<Tab value="expanded">
```tsx
import * as CookieBanner from "@c15t/react/cookie-banner";

const Banner = () => {
	return (
		<CookieBanner.Root>
			<CookieBanner.Card>
				<CookieBanner.Header>
					<CookieBanner.Title>Custom Title</CookieBanner.Title>
					<CookieBanner.Description>Your detailed description here</CookieBanner.Description>
				</CookieBanner.Header>
				<CookieBanner.Footer>
					<CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
						<CookieBanner.RejectButton>Decline All</CookieBanner.RejectButton>
						<CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>Preferences</CookieBanner.CustomizeButton>
					</CookieBanner.FooterSubGroup>
					<CookieBanner.AcceptButton>Accept All</CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
				</CookieBanner.Footer>
			</CookieBanner.Card>
		</CookieBanner.Root>
	);
};
````

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Customization

The Cookie Banner is designed to adapt to your application's visual style. Here are the main ways to customize its appearance:

### Using Themes

Here are the available theme variables:

<auto-type-table path="../../../node_modules/@c15t/react/src/components/cookie-banner/theme.ts" name="CookieBannerTheme" />

The theme prop provides a straightforward way to customize the banner's appearance:

```tsx
import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";

const CustomCookieBanner = () => {
  return (
    <CookieBanner
      theme={{
        "banner.root": "",
        "banner.title": "",
        "banner.description": "",
        "banner.footer": "",
        "banner.root": "",
        "banner.card": "",
        "banner.header.root": "",
        "banner.header.title": "",
        "banner.header.description": "",
        "banner.footer": "",
        "banner.footer.sub-group": "",
        "banner.overlay": "",
        "banner.footer.reject-button": "",
        "banner.footer.customize-button": "",
        "banner.footer.accept-button": "",
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### Using CSS Modules

For more traditional styling approaches, you can use CSS modules:

```tsx
import { CookieBanner } from "@c15t/react";
import styles from "./cookie-banner.module.css";

const CSSModuleCookieBanner = () => {
  return (
    <CookieBanner
      theme={{
        "banner.root": styles.banner,
        "banner.title": styles.title,
        "banner.description": styles.description,
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### Using Existing Components

You can integrate your own component library using the `asChild` prop:

```tsx
import * as CookieBanner from "@c15t/react/cookie-banner";
import { Button } from "./your-components";

const CustomAcceptButton = () => {
  return (
    <CookieBanner.AcceptButton asChild>
      <Button variant="primary">Accept All Cookies</Button>
    </CookieBanner.AcceptButton>
  );
};
```

## Scroll Locking

The Cookie Banner supports scroll locking, a technique that prevents users from interacting with your website until they've made a cookie consent choice.

```tsx
<CookieBanner 
  lockScroll={true}
/>
```

When enabled, scroll locking:
- Prevents page scrolling and interaction
- Displays a background overlay
- Ensures users must make a privacy choice before accessing content

For best results, use scroll locking together with [focus trapping](#focus-trapping) to ensure complete keyboard accessibility.

  For detailed implementation guides, best practices, and compliance considerations, see our [Scroll Locking Guide](/docs/framework/react/guides/scroll-locking).
</Callout>

## Accessibility

The Cookie Banner is built with accessibility in mind:

- Proper ARIA roles and labels (role="dialog", aria-modal="true")
- Keyboard navigation and interaction support
- Focus management and trapping
- Screen reader announcements
- Semantic HTML structure

These features work automatically, ensuring all users can interact with your privacy controls effectively.

### Focus Trapping

The Cookie Banner implements focus trapping when it's displayed, which is an essential accessibility feature that prevents keyboard focus from moving outside the banner. This behavior:

- **Ensures users complete the consent flow** before interacting with other page elements
- **Prevents accidental interaction** with content that shouldn't be accessible yet
- **Helps compliance** with accessibility guidelines like WCAG 2.4.3 (Focus Order)

#### Implementation Details

Focus trapping in the Cookie Banner works through the `CookieBannerCard` component, which:

1. Uses the [`useFocusTrap`](/docs/framework/react/hooks/use-focus-trap) hook internally
2. Automatically sets `tabIndex={0}` on the container
3. Applies proper ARIA attributes (`role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"`)
4. Remembers the previously focused element and restores it when closed
5. Cycles focus between interactive elements when Tab is pressed

You can control focus trapping with the `trapFocus` prop:

```tsx
// Default behavior (recommended)
<CookieBanner trapFocus={true} />

// Disable focus trapping (use with caution)
<CookieBanner trapFocus={false} />
```

<Callout>
  Focus trapping is enabled by default and recommended for accessibility compliance. For more details on implementation and best practices, see our [useFocusTrap hook documentation](/docs/hooks/use-focus-trap).
</Callout>

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for optimal implementation:

1. Place the banner at the root level of your application
2. Keep the title and description clear and concise
3. Use the pre-assembled version unless you need custom layouts
4. Test the banner across different screen sizes
5. Ensure your theme maintains sufficient contrast ratios
6. Consider [scroll locking](#scroll-locking) for strict compliance scenarios
7. Test with keyboard navigation to ensure accessibility
