## ✅ COMPLETED (Just Fixed)

- ✅ **Sitemap regenerated** - Now includes all package pages
- ✅ **Internal links added** - "Learn More" links from homepage package cards to dedicated pages

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 2. Google Search Console Submission (CRITICAL)

**You must do this TODAY to start getting organic traffic:**

1. **Go to Google Search Console** (https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. **Submit these URLs for indexing:**
   ```
   https://ponyclub.gr/en/package-1
   https://ponyclub.gr/en/package-2
   https://ponyclub.gr/en/packages/rafting-riding
   https://ponyclub.gr/el/package-1
   https://ponyclub.gr/el/package-2
   https://ponyclub.gr/el/packages/rafting-riding
   ```

3. **Submit updated sitemap:**
   - Go to Sitemaps section in GSC
   - Submit: `https://ponyclub.gr/sitemap.xml`
   - Monitor indexing status

### 3. Build and Deploy Updated Sitemap

**Run these commands to deploy the sitemap fix:**

```bash
# Regenerate sitemap with package pages
node scripts/generate-sitemap-data.js

# Build and deploy
pnpm build
```

### 4. Navigation Menu Updates (SEO Critical)

**Add package links to main navigation for better internal linking:**

You need to update your navigation components to include links to package pages:

- Add "Packages" dropdown menu with links to `/package-1` and `/package-2`
- Or add direct "Package 1" and "Package 2" menu items
- This helps Google discover and crawl the pages

### 5. Footer Links (SEO Boost)

**Add package page links to your footer:**
- Include links to both package pages in footer
- Use descriptive anchor text like "Rafting & Horse Riding Package"
- This provides additional internal linking signals
